# ESPN-Cricket-Dashboard
This dashboard is maid to Analyze Sri Lanka Cricket Stats 
I built an ESPN Cricket Power BI Dashboard using publicly available cricket statistics from the ESPN Cricinfo Statsguru database (https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html
), which provides comprehensive batting, bowling, and fielding records for international players. I scraped the required match and player data directly from the website and then transformed it using Power Query in Power BI to clean, structure, and prepare the dataset for analysis. I used DAX functions to calculate player rankings and to rank strike rates across formats. The final interactive dashboard consists of three report pages Batting, Bowling, and Fielding that allow users to explore and compare career statistics of all Sri Lankan players who have represented Sri Lanka from their very first match to the present day. This tool can be used by analysts, fans, and selectors for performance insights and historical comparisons.
